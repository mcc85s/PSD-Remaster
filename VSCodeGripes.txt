I will write the issues I have with VSCode over ISE.

1) would be nice to import themes that I made for my ISE editor.
2) cannot use the mouse to copy and paste from console to script environment... that's a definite deal breaker.
3) there's no color scheming in the console. In ISE, you have two different things to apply a color theme to, and while having multiple consoles to toggle/make available is pretty cool... no color options.
4) this may be because I disabled script analyzer since I like to use heavy aliasing... but I don't see intellisense popping up in the command prompt.
Not to mention, it's loading intellisense for a lot of other things rather than the task at hand. 
so if I'm editing a ps1 file, it shouldn't be pulling up extensions for javascript and so forth.
5) It would be nice to enable some transparencies, lighting, or shadows...
6) control+mouse wheel to zoom in/out would be nice as well.

Other than that, it is definitely easier to manage the work with VSCode, but ^ those things are a hinderance to my productivity in their current state.
