^ Finding out who this guy *really* is. He's always there... With that smug look on his face... hands in the air like he's trying to say "who knows." Well *I'll* tell you my theory... He's the guy who runs Microsoft. As in, the guy even Bill Gates answers to... But, the guy that Bill Gates answers to... it's not this guy. Nope. That guy that Bill Gates answers to, answers to some other guy. And then that guy answers to some other guy. Unfortunately, I'm not certain how many guys/girls answer to each other until ^ this guy/girl is finally reached, but... if I had to take a guess, I would say, **the answer is rather obscure**. Now, if *I* find out who he is... I will gladly let everyone know that I have determined his true identity. I cannot specify as to whether or not I could share the information of who this individual would be...? But I will definitely let you know if I ever manage to 'find out who the hell this guy OR girl is'... even if I can't tell you their name. I'll let you know that I did indeed, find out. Who that person is. And that I know them now, but only after said event occurs. Or if... that event happens...

# Look...
I don't know who the hell ^ this guy/girl is yet, so, chill out...

# Hybrid | Desired State Controller
This is a personal fork of the project I am working on found here, github.com/secure-digits-plus-llc/Hybrid-DesiredStateController
However this is a lot more hands on with the PSD project and 'integrating' my project 'Hybrid' with 'PSD-Master', and I'm rebadging it as "PSD-Remaster". This includes GUI interfaces, network connection stuff, Active Directory, Certificates,  drivers, images, manuals on how to be a lame/obnoxious bastard, and a damn kitchen sink just for laughs. No really. When you use this program, you will receive a new kitchen sink from the department of kitchen sinks. I don't have their number or address, so don't ask.

# What are the intentions of this project ?
To establish the tools necessary to secure any network of any size, starting from the ground up, or from the sky down.

Even if there are no computers in that network. Even if it isn't a network. Even if it's two fricken cans with a damn string between them. I'm not certain how the hell I'm gonna make it work for all of that, but I'm absolutely certain that if it can indeed be completed, 'I will be the first person to find a way to do it.' Or at the very least, I'll be the first person to determine, "it is in fact impossible."

# Scope of project at hand
Making these things suck a lot less... OS deployment, distribution, networking, network security, firmware, file systems, web servers, server service setup, Active Directory deployment and configuration, DNS, DHCP, WDS, MDT, WinPE, WinADK, MDT, Virtualization, Application management, User Environment Virtualization and User State Migration, and showing Microsoft how to use all of these tools correctly.  No, really. They, like, don't know yet. Weird, right? You would think that they would know how to use them correctly.... but hey. You live and learn I guess.

# That Microsoft jab sounds retarded AF.
Well it's staying. Besides... Hybrid-DSC will do all of these things better than a lame ass F-35. 

It'll be so far outside the box? That people will say "you're reinventing the wheel dude." 

I'm gonna share a secret with you. *I'm not reinventing the wheel.* Cause it's *a lot harder than that.*

Because... I'm inventing the 'equations' that tell the 'cpu' how to 'vectorize a mask' that turn into the 'data' that recreate that 100GB image you use, with kilobytes of instructions, therefore 'achieving a massive reduction in size' of said 'data in question' far beyond the best 'compression that exists' by using 3-10% of the original data, and then turning it back into 100% because I found a way to 'bypass sending all of that fricken data cause I'm not a lazy bastard.'

# Sounds like you're chasing unicorns.

I'm not though. I'm making the blueprints that the guy who makes said wheel has to look at, in order to 'recreate that damn wheel', but like, 'correctly'... And, on top of that...? I get to do what's called "fail miserably over and over until 'stuff finally works...'

I don't know what everyone else calls it, but... I call it 'swearing at my god damn computer a lot.' 
If *that* doesn't sound like *fun* to you, oh, well- you have *no idea* what a blast you're missing out on. No, really. IT IS ALWAYS A LOT OF FUN LET ME TELL YOU (*I'm lying*...)

# Sounds like a lot of work
Well, it's not. Only a sissy would say that. It's a breeze. It's a walk in the park. In fact, I have already finished the entire thing, I'm just being a little sissy about how it looks and works and making sure it doesn't cause errors or sucks, and that's the part that takes the most time. The actual idea and making it work correctly, 'that's the easy part.' The hard part is 'feeling like it's cool enough for anyone else yet.' Which... that should tell you how much of a jerk I am. I'm keeping the cool part of what I'm developing to myself like the jerk that I am. While you, you're there, wondering when the hell I'm gonna be done with this fricken thing, and you know what? It doesn't matter. I mean... it does.... but, hey. F-35's cost a lot of money bro. I will have it done before you can cash in a 2070 then-year dollar. How about that?

# What is the 'point' of doing all of this?
Short answer is, making things suck a lot less. For free. Cause, someone should've done that already but they didn't, so a lot of things 'suck.'

Moreover.... have you ever gotten a virus, malware, or looked into the depths of DCOM ? There's a lot to 'make certain of' that security is maintained. So when Intel is a retard and causes this thing called 'Meltdown/Spectre', and 'you tell people that the damn 'exploit' CANNOT BE PATCHED OUT VIA SOFTWARE OR FIRMWARE, well guess what. That crashes the security of any network or topology and it means that everyone should just leave their fricken doors and cars unlocked at all times. That's what Intel expects everyone to do. Why? I don't know. They are retarded like that. I wish that they weren't, but, 'Meltdown.', 'Spectre.' Here's a link to a video where I talk about firmware. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jkDPv9H6BQ

The video in question has not been real popular, mainly because, rich crybaby's that run company's that 'suck at the work they get paid real well to suck at doing...' well, what happens is, "they are the people that don't like these types of videos where I explain to you the process involved in them sucking at the job you pay them a lot of money to 'suck ass at', but they somehow, 'don't agree with that statement', because guess what... 'they want to continue scamming you like the pansies that they are...'

# The bottom line
***Security is a boolean value***, if even one little thing isn't secure, like the god damn CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT... well, then it can crash the **entire topology of your network** when felonious idiots name 'Intel Executives' decide to do something 'retarded to your network'. SCCM tries to safeguard this by *digitally signing everything*, but even as 'hardened as it is'... it still has it's fair of vulnerabilities, for instance....
1) Sometimes files/hash values or digital signatures can be misreported if the firmware/CPU is not valid
2) It's slow as hell. At everything it does. 
And, even though Michael Niehaus IS IN FACT A GENIUS, actually scratch that... he's a *god damn wizard named Merlin*...
Even though geniuses have to deal with **a lot of idiots**, then what you get is this compromised thing known as System Center Configuration Manager... where it *could* be way cooler, faster, better, suck a lot less, be fun to use, interesting, enjoyable experience... it is none of those things.

The reason for this is because... it takes a *lot of time* for changes to *propogate across a network* especially when you work at a god damn bank or a hospital. Then you're dealing with a lot of money and or risk of being responsible for people dying on accident... SO.... **GUESS IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO BE SLOW AND CAREFUL SOMETIMES**. Sorta like sex. Sometimes.

Anyway... if you push updates in a 2 hour maintenance Window, and you forgot to put something somewhere for all of those machines... oh, well guess what. Now you get to wait until next month to install that critical update that you forgot to put in. Which means, you may as well just *kick yourself in the nutsack for fun*. No really, why the hell not?

Hardened security is good for 'every half a year'... where you don't feel like losing the data in question but you also don't feel like taking a god damn baseball bat to the system in question that doesn't feel like doing whatever the hell you told it to do. So, there's that. Besides, probably not a cheap habit to smash everything with a baseball bat in order to 'fix it'.

The alternative, is to use the most badass utility to date, and it's called MDfrickenT. Yeah. The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit. And it's so badass, that you can't even... you cannot even understand how cool it is until you sit with it and stare at how awesome it is for several months straight. No really... Mykael Nystrom said it's like 'watching paint dry', but... **its a lot more fun than that**...

Now, *you could use SCCM and MDT in tandem* even though 'they're the same god damn program'... One is slow, the other is not. So. Yeah.

You could also use the Media Creation tool and download the same thing from each computer, and take 10 years doing the same thing that MDT and SCCM can do, in like IDK, 2 hours. You could also, randomly decide to shoot yourself in the foot, slash the tires you your own car, and then WALK to every damn node on your network, and you know, install the version of windows in question manually and you know, take several centuries to do all of that... But I would say "probably doesn't sound real fun or like you couldn't do that faster with some better tool."

Guess what. Hybrid-DSC is the solution accelerator for the MDT/SCCM solution accelerator. So it's like a solution accelerator cubed. Bam.

# Now, you're an administrator...
...and when you see that a user hasn't rebooted their machine for 3 months, you know it's because they have some files open and they don't know how to hit the 'save' button... I mean, we all know that he does. He also knows that he does. But, for whatever reason, he just chooses not to do that... nor to reboot his god damn computer to install the security update. You know, the one that protects people from the damn thing that somehow 'removes money from their damn account...' or 'tells them that they can click on this thing and some hot girl will suddenly be your wife or whatever'... and, because he is an idiot that would fail to do all of these things that HE SHOULD'VE FRICKEN DONE ALREADY... well... then you have to talk to this individual as if you 'don't want to smack him across the face for being so dumb'... but you 'definitely WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE... he's the damn reason everyone at your company has to 'wipe their god damn machine again.' I know. It SHOULD be time to 'kick this guy in the nuts.' However... you can't really do that. Even if you WANT to... you just can't. Which ... *sigh*.

There's a stigma involved with 'rebooting a machine.' I'm not impervious to that either... I hate rebooting my damn machine as well, which is why "i'm building a way to never have to require a reboot because I thought of a way to keep the operating system in memory without having to tell Intel that they suck at the work they get paid real well to suck ass at doing... But the problem is, until Windows is re-engineered to perform live updating, meaning, when it can "update itself without ever needing to actually reboot"... then what happens is that the security updates that kept getting pushed off, they don't protect a critical vulnerability that now get to allow '100-browser-tab Tom', to enjoy the next best thing to getting kicked in the nutsack. It's called "convincing you this individual that they no longer have any money"... AKA, Identity Theft.

# This sounds like a hard job Michael Cook.
I know. However, I like to refer to this whole process as "attempting to play Bobby Fisher" at chess, and, for every move that HE makes in about idk, a single second? I get the wonderful task of having to be confused as to what the next move is for 'several fricken days straight.' 

It's sort of like 'Bobby lets me actually move the pieces and then analyze what he might do next, and if I feel like it was a dumb move? Then, Bobby doesn't care if I move my piece back to the spot it was last in. Cause he's cool like that. He knows he's a tough son of  a bitch at chess, so, that's what he'll do to give you a fair chance. So, yeah. IDK if YOU have ever played Bobby Fisher in chess, but, it's about a 700 out of 10 in terms of difficulty , so... guess what..? I swear at my god damn computer a lot. Is it healthy? Probably not. But it's whatever. I'm not being a sissy about it so, it is what it is.

# At least you have a sense of humor, so that's a plus.
I mean there are two types of people in the world, there are the negative Nancy's, and the positive Pam's. Granted, you could make the case that there are some sideways Sara's or maybe some halfway harry's... I guess either way you look at it? The challenge is being able to make the most out of the experience. And somehow enjoying what it feels like to kick yourself in the nuts over and over and calling that 'my job.' Apparently... *sigh*

That said? Making some things happen with some pretty cool awesome stuff? Well, it's probably too cool for me to even be able to use said terms in question, in a god damn sentence. That's how cool and awesome this stuff is, so, it's whatevs.
